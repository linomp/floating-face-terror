# Face Detection with JavaScript

- Based on https://youtu.be/CVClHLwv-4I
  - Note: In this video, the `startVideo` function inside `script.js` is slightly outdated. Watch until minute 5:50, then refer back to this repo for the fixed `startVideo` function. Everything else is fine.

- [`getUserMedia` documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia)

- Bonus: there is a face recognition library for cats! (maybe too slow for real-time..)
